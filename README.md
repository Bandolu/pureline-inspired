# pureline-inspired

This repository is inspired by [chris-marsh/pureline](https://github.com/chris-marsh/pureline.git).

And the code of this repository is based on [chris-marsh/pureline](https://github.com/chris-marsh/pureline.git).

So I will not write a documentation of `pureline-inspired`. Please understand.
